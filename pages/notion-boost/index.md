## Features details

### ✔ Show sticky outline

Show sticky outline (table of contents) for pages that have headings or sub-headings. The outline will be shown on the right side of the page. Very useful for navigating a page with lots of content.

<Img src={outline} type="ss" />

### ✔ Set small text & full width for all pages

Option to set small text and full width for all pages by default. This locally adjusts the text and width without clicking on the Notion page toggles. So no page change is saved to the server.

<Img src={fullwidth} type="ss" />

### ✔ 'Scroll to top' button

Added button at the bottom-right corner of page for scrolling back to top. Quite useful for lengthy pages. The button will be visible only when the page has scrolled down a bit.

<Img src={scrollbtn} type="ss" />

### ✔ Close Slash command menu after space

Slash command menu which appears when pressing '/' key will be closed back by pressing the space key.

<Img src={hideslash} type="ss" />

### ✔ Don't show Slash command menu when pressing '/'

Don't show the Slash command menu when pressing '/' key. Slash command menu will still be shown by clicking + ⁝⁝ icon. This setting can't be enabled along with 'Close Slash command menu after space' and vice-versa.

<Img src={disableslashmenu} type="ss" />

### ✔ Hide floating help button from all pages

This button is located on the bottom-right corner of pages.

<Img src={helpbtn} type="ss" />

### ✔ Bolder text in dark mode

Fix poorly recognizable bold text when using Notion in dark mode

<Img src={boldertext} type="ss" />

### ✔ Hide comments section from all pages

comment section is useless when working solo
<Img src={commenthide} type="ss" />
