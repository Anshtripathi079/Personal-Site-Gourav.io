I’ve been a Windows (power-) user for a decade, and throughout the journey, I found tools and apps which made me work more efficiently on Windows. In this article, I categorized these tools under their use cases. All tools are free to use (or freemium with a generous free version), and many of them are even open-source (source code links are provided where applicable).

> PS: I switched to Mac (M1 MBP) at starting of 2022. Loving it so far. Someday, I’ll probably write a similar list of tools I use on Mac.

## Productivity

### Ditto - Clipboard manager

Ditto is a lightweight and feature-rich clipboard manager for Windows. Trigger a hotkey to invoke popup window and paste any of your past clipboard items. It’s a game-changer. Supports images, text transformation on the fly, search, pin items, auto-clear entries, etc. Works in every input field.

(_for advanced users_)

Multiple tools are available to add/edit/delete entries in your right-click context menu.

## Image viewers and editors

### Image Glass - Image viewer

<Img src={imageglass} type="ss" caption="" />

### [Paint.net](http://Paint.net) - Image editor

Not to get confused with Windows built-in paint app. Paint.net is an easy-to-use and lightweight image editing software with support for layers, unlimited undo, special effects, and a wide variety of powerful [plugins](https://www.getpaint.net/doc/latest/InstallPlugins.html) to extend its capabilities.

It has been compared to other digital photo editing software packages such as Adobe Photoshop, Corel Paint Shop Pro, but it’s free and doesn’t suck up all the RAM!

- Homepage: [https://www.getpaint.net/](https://www.getpaint.net/)

<Img src={paint_net} type="ss" caption="" />

[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) is another popular image editor, but it has a considerable learning curve and an overkill for quick edits.

### RIOT - Image optimization

## Screen capture

### ShareX - Multipurpose

ShareX is probably the most advanced screen capturing, annotating, and recording tool out there for Windows.

You can build your own workflow like a single shortcut for:

- Record GIF of a region → upload it to Imgur → copy upload URL to the clipboard
- Capture screenshot → copy image to the clipboard and save it to a folder

These are just the basic ones I used frequently, but they could get pretty advanced if you’d like.

Apart from capturing screenshots and recording GIF/mp4, it also supports other utility tools like color picker, screen ruler, image editor, file sharing, etc. A must-have tool for designers and web developers.

- Homepage: [https://getsharex.com/](https://getsharex.com/)

## Local Markdown editors

Local MD editors are editors where 100% of your content is stored in a folder on your local machine, nothing goes out. You could still use external services like Google Drive, Dropbox, etc., to keep your folder backed up.

If you’re looking for online markdown editor apps, there are a few popular ones like Notion (https://notion.so) or Roam Research ([https://roamresearch.com/](https://roamresearch.com/)).

### Typora

Typora is an excellent markdown editor for writing and exporting content in markdown format. Unlike other markdown editors, it provides inline-preview, which means there is no need to open a side preview pane to see how it looks.
