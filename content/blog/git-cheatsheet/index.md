When I collaborate with others using Git, I often have to google to find the right git commands for various situations.
Situations like how to pull changes without committing local files, save uncommitted changes in the current branch and switch, add new changes to the last commit, reset my local branch to main, revert the latest commit from local and remote, etc.
So, I decided to write these down in one place as a handy cheatsheet so that it's easier for me (and hopefully others) to recall and use.

### Jargon

- `remote` - remote means server like github, bitbucket, etc.

- `local` - your git repo stored in PC

- `remote repository` - your git repo stored on github, bitbucket, etc.

- `origin` - origin is _your_ remote repo (from where you did `git clone`)

- `upstream` - upstream is _their_ main repo (from which you have forked, useful to get latest changes from _their_ repo releases)

- `tag` - you can create a tag when doing software releases

- `main` - it's the head branch named `main` (default created branch for any new repo, earlier it was used to be `master`)

- `HEAD` - head always refers to the latest commit on your current branch.

- `fetch` - just download latest changes from a `remote` branch in separate path and do not integrate with your repo. `git merge` is required to integrate these changes

- `pull` - means getting latest changes from a remote branch into your branch (`git pull` = `git fetch` + `git merge`)
  To pull from your remote branch: `git pull`

  To pull from remote `main` branch: `git pull origin main`

- `commit` - means adding a record entry of your changes e.g. `git commit -m "added feature X"`

- `push` - means uploading your local `commits` to a remote server.
  To push commits to your remote branch: `git push`
  To push commits to remote `main` branch: `git push origin main`

- `merge conflict` - when you make changes to a file and someone else make some other changes to the same file and along the same line numbers you get merge conflict. Happens often during `pull`/`push` or merging a `PR`.

## Git workflows

- Option A: Clone main repo -> create a new branch -> do your thing -> send PR to `main` branch
- Option B: Fork from the main repo -> do your thing -> send PR

### Commit specification

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for adding human and machine readable meaning to commit messages.

Lint commit messages using [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint).

Benefits:

- Automatically generating CHANGELOGs.
- Automatically determining a semantic version bump (based on the types of commits landed).
- Communicating the nature of changes to teammates, the public, and other stakeholders.
- Triggering build and publish processes.

Syntax (v1.0.0):

- `fix:` a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning). ex: `fix: prevent racing of requests`
- `feat:` a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning). ex: `feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs`
- `!:` appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). ex: `feat!: send an email to the customer when a product is shipped` , `chore!: drop support for Node 6`
- types other than `fix:` and `feat:` are allowed, for example [@commitlint/config-conventional](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional) recommends `build:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, and others.

## Advanced Tips

### Exclude file(s) from git revision without adding it to .gitignore

Have you ever wanted to create some file(s) in your repo but do not want it to commit or show in the git changes?

Your first thought would be to mention that file in `.gitignore` and commit it, but what if I told you there's a way without even adding it to your repo's `.gitignore`:

#### per repository basis

Let's suppose you want to have a folder `drafts` and ignore it and everything in it from git:

- create a folder `drafts` in your repo
- add some files to it
- those files will currently show as untracked files when running `git status`
- Now, create a `.gitignore` file inside `drafts` and write `*` in it. That's it! Run `git status` and you wouldn't see any changes!

  - you can create as many files or folders inside `drafts` and it wouldn't show up in git changes.
  - next time, you can use this one-liner command to create a `drafts` folder and put a `.gitignore` file:

  ```bash
  mkdir drafts && echo '*' > ./drafts/.gitignore
  ```

#### for all repositories

- We'll be using a global `.gitignore` for it that takes higher precedence over a repo's `.gitignore` file.
- let's suppose you want to hide `.DS_Store`, `.env.production` files from all current and future repo's:
  1. changes directory to `/Users/{User}`
     - `cd ~`
  2. create an empty file with .gitignore
     - Mac: `touch .gitignore`
     - Windows: `type nul > .gitignore` or `echo.> .gitignore`
  3. Tell git to use that file as global ignore
     - `git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore`
  4. open this `.gitignore` file:
     - Mac: `open -a TextEdit ~/.gitignore`
     - Windows: `notepad ~/.gitignore`
  5. and mention files (or patterns) to ignore:
  ```txt
  .DS_Store
  .env.production
  ```

## Add local git repo to Github

Create new repo on Github and push local git repo code to it.

(requires [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/))

Run inside root of local git repo:

```
gh repo create ( -> Push an existing local repository to GitHub)
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Stage & Commit

```
git add . (stage ALL new,modified files)
```

```
git add -A (stage ALL new,modified,deleted files)
```

```
git add file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

```
git add -i (interactive add/revert)
```

```
git commit -m 'fixed this and that'
```

#### Git append (commit using last commit msg)

```
git commit --reuse-message=HEAD
```

#### Git add+commit

- It also adds newly created files

```
git add -A ; git commit -m "Your Message" (powershell)
git add -A && git commit -m "Your Message" (bash)
```

#### case-sensitive filename change not showing up in git changes

- method 1:

  1. `git mv -f path/YOURFileName.ts path/yourFileName.ts`
  2. commit

- method 2:

  1.  Rename `YOURFileName.ts` to `whatever.ts`
  2.  Stage that file
  3.  Now rename `whatever.ts` to `yourFileName.ts`
  4.  Stage that file again
  5.  commit

- method 3: one time process for all repos
  - tell Git to be case-sensitive : `git config core.ignorecase false`
  - use this method if you haven't pushed the file you want to rename to remote else it'll store both files. ex: YOURFileName.ts and yourFileName.ts

## Push/Pull

```
git push origin
```

```
git push upstream
```

```
git push upstream/some_branch
```

```
git push origin HEAD (push local changes to remote branch with same name)
```

### Pull from main to dev branch

```
git pull origin main (pull latest changes from remote main branch into local dev branch)
```

### Download big repository on poor bandwidth

## Remove untracked files from local and remote

1. add those files to `.gitignore`
2. `git rm -r --cached .`
3. `git add .`
4. `git commit -am "Remove ignored files"`
5. `git push`

## compare file/line revision | see line/file history

- to see who and when made a change to a specific line in a file:

### using VSCode extension

1. install [GitLens VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
2. go to line, and hover over gitlens gray text
3. click on icon that says: "open blame prior to this change"
4. you can keep repeating it to see throughout the history of line/file.

Tip: If you don't always want to see blame info at cursor location, you can switch it off via VSCode command pallete: "Gitlens: Toggle Line Blame"

### using git blame command

- https://stackoverflow.com/a/49144664/3073272

### using git bisect command

- https://stackoverflow.com/a/37306623/3073272

## PR / Review

### create PR inside VSCode

- CLI: `gh pr create --fill` (need to install [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/))

- GUI: use VSCode extension: [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github)

- Github:

  1Visit repo on github.com and switch to your branch.

  2.  Go to `Pull requests` section -> `New pull request`

### List PRs

- `gh pr list`

### See all changes from a PR as uncommitted changes

Option A:

1. checkout PR (100) in 'detached HEAD' state
   `git fetch origin pull/100/head && git checkout FETCH_HEAD`
2. show as uncommitted changes
   `git reset main`
3. switch back to main branch and carry these changes
   `git switch -`

Option B:

- Install VSCode extension: [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github).

## Branch

### checkout remote branch

(you can also enable `autofetch` in VSCode settings to avoid doing `git fetch` every time)

```
git fetch && git checkout branch_name
```

### Create local branch

code will be copied from current branch

```
  git checkout -b feature_x
```

### create local branch from some other branch

```
git checkout -b feature_x main
```

### push newly created branch to remote

branch is not available to github.com unless you push it separately

```
  git push --set-upstream origin feature_x
```

### Add Remote branch

origin is your repo on github.com

```
  git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

### Add upstream

upstream is their main repo from which you have forked

```
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/their_user/repo.git
```

### Create new local version branch of an upstream branch

```
  git checkout -b feature_x upstream/main (main is the branch name)
```

### switch branch

```
  git checkout feature_x
```

### delete the branch

```
git branch -d feature_x
```

### Get URL of Github repo

```
git remote show origin
```

### Change origin (link to different repo URL on github)

```
git remote set-url origin new.git.url
```

## Work between branches

### get latest from master branch

Tip: `merge` is easier than `rebase` if there are multiple commits and conflicts. [stackoverflow explanation](https://stackoverflow.com/a/11219380/3073272)

#### merge

1. make local `main` branch upto date with origin/upstream

```
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout feature
```

2. merge

```
git merge main
git commit -m 'merge'
```

3. resolve conflicts if any. accept _incoming changes_ instead of _current changes_.
4. Push changes

```
git push
```

> To abort merge midway `git merge --abort`

#### rebase

- Get all commits from `main` branch into `feature` branch i.e. sync `feature` with `main`

1. Start rebase

```
git checkout feature
git rebase origin/main
```

2. Resolve merge conflicts if any

   1. accept _current changes_ instead of _incoming changes_.
   2. once resolved, run `git add .`
   3. continue after resolving merge conflicts `git rebase --continue`
   4. Repeat same steps untill no more merge conflicts

3. Force push and done

```
git push -f
```

> To abort rebase midway (like during conflicts): `git rebase --abort`

#### pull

`git pull` is the combination of `git fetch` + `git merge`

### Open file from another branch w/o switching

It'll create a new `file` in your repo.

```
git show branch:path/to/file > file
```

### Push from one branch to another

```
git push origin from_branch:to_branch
```

### Git stash - locally store changes without commit

- it locally stores changes and resets any modified files

```
git stash -u (-u means --include-untracked)
```

tip: Give stash a name so that it's easier to recall later in case of multiple stashes:

```
git stash push -m "my_stash"
```

- see list of all stashes

```
git stash list
```

- retrieve locally stored changes from stash

  - retrieve last stash and remove it from stash list. You won't be able to retrieve it again.
    `git stash pop`
  - retrieve last stash but keep it in the stash list. You can retrieve it again later.
    `git stash apply`

- retrieve a particular stash but also keep it in the stash list:
  1. find stash index name from `git stash list`
  2. use that index name: `git stash apply stash@{n}`

### Git pull without committing local changes

- hide your local uncommitted changes temporarily

```
git stash -u (-u means --include-untracked)
```

- get latest changes

```
git pull
```

- now unhide your local uncommitted changes

```
git stash pop
```

### move uncommitted changes to another branch

uncommitted changes do not belong to any branch so just create/switch branch:

```
git checkout -b <new-branch>
```

### Save uncommitted changes and switch branch

1. save uncommitted changes to stack for current branch stack

```
git stash -u (-u means --include-untracked)
```

2. checkout different branch

```
git checkout B
```

3. Recover stash
   To pop stashed changes from previous `A` branch

```
git checkout A
git stash apply (will recover changes from last stack)
```

### clone uncommitted changes to new branch

1. save uncommitted changes to stack for current branch stack

```
git stash -u (-u means --include-untracked)
```

2. restore these changes back (a copy of these changes is still stored in stash list)

```
git stash apply
```

1. create/switch to different branch and these uncommitted changes will be carried:

```
git checkout -b new_branch
```

3. To recover stashed changes from previous `A` branch

```
git checkout A
git stash apply
```

### checkout a specific commit

get commit_sha1 from `git log`

```
git checkout <commit_sha1>
```

### Copy specific commit from one branch to another

Ex: copy one commit from `dev` to `main`

**using gui:**

- switch to `main`: `git checkout main`
- run `gitk --all`
- right-click on desired commit and select `Cherry-pick this commit`

**using cli:**

- get commit sha1-id you want to copy

```
git checkout dev
git log (copy desired commit_id)
(to exit type q)
```

- copy commit:

```
git checkout main
git cherry-pick <commit_id>
```

## Repo Status

```
git status
```

### Show latest commits

using cli:

```
 git log
(to exit type q)
```

using gui:

`gitk`

### Display current branch name

```
  git branch
```

## Git GUI (free)

### Windows

- [Fork](https://git-fork.com/)

### Mac

- [Fork](https://git-fork.com/)

### Git interactive commands

```
git add -i
```

### use colorful git output

```
git config color.ui true
```

## I f\*cked up

### Switch to an old commit

- Temporarily switch by creating new branch

  ```
  git checkout 0d1d7fc32  (commit id)
  ```

- Revert current branch to an older commit

  ```
  git reset --hard <commidId> && git clean -f
  ```

### Add new changes to last commit

- If you pushed last commit to remote

```
git add .
git commit --amend --no-edit (`--no-edit` to keep last commit msg)
git push --force
```

- If you didn't push the commit to remote

```
git reset HEAD^
```

Then add all files and commit again

### Resolve Merge Conflicts

- revert current merge conflicts

```
git reset --hard HEAD
```

- revert all my changes and pull latest from `main`

```
git reset --hard HEAD
git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream branch_remote
```

### Discard all uncommitted changes (local)

`git checkout .`

### Revert last local commit but keep the changes in my pc

`git reset HEAD^`

### Revert last remote commit (remote, untraceable)

1. Get that commit to local
   `git pull`

2. Remove commit locally
   `git reset HEAD^`

3. Force-push the last HEAD commit to remote
   `git push origin +HEAD`

### Revert all local changes and local commits (local)

fetch the latest history from the remote and point your local master branch at it

```
git fetch origin git reset --hard origin/main (main is the branch name)
```

### Reset local branch to it's remote

- sync local branch `main` with remote branch `main`

```
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main
git pull origin main
```

### Reset `dev` branch to `main`

```
git checkout dev
git reset --hard origin/main
git pull origin main
git push -f
```

### Clean up a fork and restart it from the upstream

```
git reset --hard upstream/main (main is the branch name of original repo)
git push origin my_branch --force (or git push origin HEAD --force)
```

## git Users

### Set

```
git config --local user.name "localuser"
git config --local user.email "localuser@example.com"
git config --global user.name "globaluser"
git config --global user.email "globaluser@example.com"
```

### Get

```
git config --local user.name
git config --local user.email
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email

git config --list
```

## Remember Me

### Remember username & password

1. Secured Way (Store globally)

```
    git config --global credential.helper manager //secured way for Windows

    git push http://example.com/repo.git
    Username: <type your username once>
    Password: <type your password once>
```

2. Unsecured way (Store globally)

```
    git config credential.helper store //username & password stored in plain-text in "%UserProfile%\.git-credentials"
    git push http://example.com/repo.git
    Username: <type your username once>
    Password: <type your password once>
```

3. Unsecured way (Store locally per repo)

```
    //saved in file 'cred' inside repo .git folder. Need to manually delete this file.
    git config credential.helper 'store --file=.git/cred'
```

4. Secured Way (Store in Cache)

```
    git config credential.helper 'cache --timeout=864000' // 10 days expiry
    git credential-cache exit // remove it from cache before timeout
```

### Remove credentials

```
git config --unset credential.helper
git config --local --unset credential.helper
git config --global --unset credential.helper
git config --system --unset credential.helper
//Windows: delete from Control Panel\User Accounts\Credential Manager
```
